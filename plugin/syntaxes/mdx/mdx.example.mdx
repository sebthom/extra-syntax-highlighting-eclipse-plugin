# JSX Features in MDX

This MDX file showcases various uses of JSX, including React components, web components, inline code, code blocks, and more.

## Inline JSX

You can include inline JSX components like `<MyButton />` directly within your Markdown content.

<MyButton label="Click Me!" onClick={() => alert('Button clicked!')} />

## Web Components

MDX also allows the integration of custom web components:

<my-web-component prop="value" />

**Note:** Ensure that the web component `<my-web-component>` is defined and imported appropriately in your project.

## Using React Components

You can embed React components seamlessly:

<Alert type="success">
  This is a success alert!
</Alert>

## Code Blocks

You can include code blocks with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return <div>Hello, JSX in MDX!</div>
}

export default MyComponent;
```

## Inline Code

Use inline code within your text, such as `const x = 10;`.
